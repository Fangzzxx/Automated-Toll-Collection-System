# Automated-Toll-Collection-System
Designed using RFID Module and Arduino.

## Introduction
This project is a demo of a **Smart Toll Tax Collection System**. Consider there are n numbers of vehicles at Toll Plaza. When these vehicles cross the **IR Sensor**, the gate will be closed. At the same time, the **LCD** will display to put the Card to the reader for scanning. Then you can put your card on **RFID** and pay your bill. When the bill is successfully paid, then you can go towards the 2nd Gate. When a vehicle crosses the 2nd IR Sensor, the gate will be opened and you can go. In case the card doesnâ€™t have a balance, you can **recharge** the card using this RFID and **Keypad** by entering the amount.
